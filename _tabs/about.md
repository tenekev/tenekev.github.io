I am a highly passionate individual when it comes to technology, networking, automation and self-hosting. I have always been fascinated by the endless possibilities and empowerment that technology brings and I am constantly seeking out new ways to learn and grow in this field. 

I am a strong believer in paying forward what I've learned and love connecting with like-minded individuals to share knowledge and collaborate on projects. 

I am a proactive learner who is never satisfied with the status quo, and I am always seeking out new challenges and ways to push the boundaries of what I can do. I am constantly seeking out new ways to improve my skills in these areas and am dedicated to staying up-to-date on the latest trends and developments by experimenting with my personal Homelab. 

I have dabbled into many aspects of the IT world - Programming, UI Design, Hardware, Selfhosting, Networking, Virtualization and Automation.

Whether working on personal projects or collaborating with others, I bring a strong sense of curiosity, determination, and dedication to everything I do. I am confident that my passion and skills in technology, networking, and self-hosting make me an asset to any team or organization. I am eager to bring my passion and expertise to any organization that shares my enthusiasm for technology.
